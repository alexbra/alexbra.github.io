In this project, I've used R and applied exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, 
outliers, and anomalies.

###Selected data set

I've choose to analyse red wines quality. There is data set contains about 1500 observation of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" red wine.
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). 
Outlier detection algorithms could be used to detect the few excellent or poor wines. 
So it could be interesting to test feature selection methods.

####Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol

####Output variable (based on sensory data):

12. quality (score between 0 and 10)
