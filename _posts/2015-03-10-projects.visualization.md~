This project is implementing of task from Data Visualization course in Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.
For this project, I've created a data visualization from a data set of FIFA developments projects that 
showcase how this worldwide organisation invest money in football development. 

####Code source on GitHub

####Data source 
[http://datahub.io/dataset/fifa-development-projects][datahub]

`fifa_all_projects.csv` file include information about more than 600 FIFA projects. 
To make my analysis more convenient and deeper I've added some new features in this data set.

###Description

<p> 
The Goal Programme enables beneficiary member associations to implement projects designed to develop football in their countries. 
It is an expression of solidarity that gives national associations with few resources at their disposal the tools they need to function and grow.
</p>

*Information from FIFA official website http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/footballdevelopment/projects/goalprogramme/
<p>
The Goal Programme supports the following classes of projects:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Headquarters</li>
<li>Technical centre</li>
<li>Football pitch</li>
<li>Football academy (including creation of youth academies)</li>
<li>IT projects (modernisation of national association computer systems)</li>
<li>Other</li>
</ul>
<p>
I've divided my visualization on 4 tabs. On the first one you can explore overview of all projects by country.
On the others stored additional information which may explain some details of investments. 
</p>
<p>
Just press Play FIFA story button on the first tab to figure out most important points about Goal programme.
