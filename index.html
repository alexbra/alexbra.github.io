                My name is Alex Brazhenko. I am recognized as an expert in automation of HR services, talent management, education and e-learning with 10+ years of coding experience. In 2009, I took the job at DTEK Energy company as a developer of a corporate learning portal. This is an internal website of the Corporate University DTEK Academy. Since 2012, I have held a team lead position here. At the same time, I participate at conferences, workshops and webinars in E-Learning every year.
</p>
<p>
Previously, I was the web developer at a financial company. 
I started my career as a teaching assistant at the computer science department of Donetsk National Technical University. 
Thus, skills in both education and coding led me to my current position.
</p>
<p>
At my current job, I have deployed learning and talent management systems from scratch based on LMS WebTutor, 
which became one of the biggest in Ukraine. Working with different reports, 
SQL queries and data wrangling operations, I have discovered data analysis as a new direction for personal growth. 
In April 2015, I graduated from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree and accomplished several projects connected with data. 
I continue to develop in this field and am looking for opportunities to explore business and social problems and applicable solutions. 
My goal is to identify how to improve efficiency and quality based on analytical findings and use big data to make effective decisions.
